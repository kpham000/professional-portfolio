# professional-portfolio

This is my professional portfolio homework, there is a picture attatched as a guide for this assignment. I used a combination of html and advanced css in this assignment. i was able to use flexbox for the layout of my page and also the nav bar is interactive as well. When you click on the " about work, contact" on the nav bar it will automatically scroll down to that section of the page. 

The TAs for my class are: Jandy, Louis, and Brett.
